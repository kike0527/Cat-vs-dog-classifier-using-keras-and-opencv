# Cat-vs-dog-classifier-using-keras-and-opencv
A deep model is used with an accurracy of 86% using kaggle data set.

This is a fundamental deep learning exercise to start working with python and the convolutional neural networks (CNN) provided by Keras (Supported by Tensorflow).
The data used in this exercise is given by the Kaggle competition and can be downloaded [HERE](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)

We can use the main.py directly or edit the main.ipynb jupyter notebook aswell.

```
python main.py
```
or
```
>jupyter notebook
```
from a terminal and open the notebook file.
